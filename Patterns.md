## ARRAYS

### Sliding Window Technique
- Iterate over sequentially
- contiguous sequence of elements (subarray/substring Problems)
- two pointers moving in the same direction
- each element only visited almost twice
- DS: Strings, Arrays, Linked lists
- Need to find out min, max,shortest, longest, contained or maybe calculate smthg based on these
- TIME COMPLEXITY : O(n)
#### Variants
- Fixed Length (MaxSum Subarray)
- Dynamic length (smallest sum greater than a given value)
- Dynamic Variants with auxillary data structure (eg. longest substring with no more than k distinc characters) constraints 1.longest substr 2. < k distinct char
