##### ‚ùóAlways dry run the code first.

## Sliding Window Technique
- Iterate ever sequentially
    - contiguous sequence of elements
    - Strings, Arrays, Linked lists
- Need to find out min, max,shortest, contained or maybe calculate smthg
### Variants
- Fixed Length (MaxSum Subarray)
- Dynamic length (smallest sum greater than a given value)
- Dynamic Variants with auxillary data structure (eg. longest substring with no more than k distinc characters) constraints 1.longest substr 2. < k distinct char
